<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am an enthusiastic web developer and have a keen interest in the design aspects of not
  only web products but also any physical products as well. My forte is
  my analytical skills and a sharp focus on minute details of different aspects
  of any subject.

<p>
  Interacting with people is one of the many things I love because it increases my
  viewport of life and helps me understand things from various perspectives. Other
  things that satisfy my curiosity needs are technological advancements, robotics,drones,music and,art among the many.I usually like to
  increase my adrenaline rush by trekking,playing badminton or basketball, and lifting
  weights.
